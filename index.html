        My favorite place I've ever been to has to be Yellowstone National Park. It is such a beautiful place with such a vast wildlife and amazing natural formations. <br>
        Favorite restaurant: <a href= "https://www.escondidonj.com/">Escondido</a> <br>
        Something that I think nobody would expect to know about me is that I have a fear of clowns.
